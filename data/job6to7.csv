Program Background

Responsibilities

The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia’s large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program’s core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia’s previous 19 years of support to Indonesia’s decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:

Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub-national service delivery.

Pillar 2: Better sub-national governance for service delivery.

Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.

SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara, Tanah Papua. In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and GEDSI.

As a leading implementing partner across Asia and the Pacific, we co-create locally led solutions in partnership with governments, communities, and stakeholders.

Program Background

Responsibilities

The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia’s large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program’s core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia’s previous 19 years of support to Indonesia’s decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:

Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub-national service delivery.
Pillar 2: Better sub-national governance for service delivery.
Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.

SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara, Tanah Papua. In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and GEDSI.

About The Team

In the Offline Merchants team, we consistently strive to implement solutions that allow our merchant partners in Indonesia (and the greater Southeast Asian region) to sell their products both online and offline. We also work to improve the merchant-partner experience through product innovation and integration with the rest of the Gojek ecosystem.

Our portfolio of products includes merchant-facing solutions that aid our subscribed merchant partners in their sales operations. Southeast Asia is a highly dynamic market, where products have to react promptly to market trends and shifts, and where product managers and business leaders need the flexibility to experiment and iterate fast. With that in mind, as the sales team, we introduce and educate potential customers on how they can benefit by using our products.

One of the biggest obstacles our team has had to overcome is figuring out the most effective way to increase our standing in the market with our Point of Sales solutions. After many weeks of research, collaboration, and trial and error, we figured out that the best way to tackle this issue was to pour a bulk of our effort into acquiring more merchant partners in various industries, leveraging heavily on the Gojek ecosystem as a whole.

We're a highly flexible team with a target-driven mindset. We manage our work hours, so long as we deliver the expected results on time. As a team, we enjoy working with each other, learning from and about one another, and having fun all along the way.

Looking for a move from engineering to product? Have you always had the desire to influence how product goes, even as an engineer?

Within DANA’s Automation, our Product Developers identify real problems and build solutions that actually work.
You’ll lead discovery, work side-by-side with engineers, and make sure what we design actually solves a real problem.

You’ll own the outcome—output is just the enabler.

🔧 What You’ll Do
Drive products end-to-end — from idea validation → delivery → impact.
Work closely with engineers to design and test scalable solutions.
Jump into technical details when needed (APIs, data, logs, debugging assistance).
Align business, design, and tech to keep progress moving.
Turn messy problems into clear, working systems.


💡 What We’re Looking For (Must-haves)
You can speak both business and tech fluently.
You love making things actually work (”will what we build actually be used or solve the issue?”)
You want the flexibility to influence either side (product & engineering)
3+ years in engineering
You’re comfortable starting with grey areas because you’re good at making things clear 😉


💡 Nice to have
You’ve led either architecture design or have led engineering team(s)
You thrive in ambiguity, take initiative, and push for clarity


💙 Why Join
We care if what we’re building is used / if it actually solves an issue
Stay hands-on while shaping product direction.
Learn fast, collaborate deeply, and make real impact.
Work in a culture that values ownership, curiosity, and action.

If you’re a senior engineer, engineering leadership, or product thinker who loves solving real problems —
this role is for you.

Program Background

Responsibilities

The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia’s large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program’s core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia’s previous 19 years of support to Indonesia’s decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:

Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub-national service delivery.
Pillar 2: Better sub-national governance for service delivery.
Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.

SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara, Tanah Papua. In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and GEDSI.

Collaboration with Cross-Functional Teams: Work closely with product managers, developers, and stakeholders throughout the design and development process. Ensure that designs are aligned with business objectives and technical constraints. Act as a liaison between design and development teams to ensure smooth handoffs and that the final product stays true to the original design vision.
Design Systems and Standards: Develop and maintain a consistent design system that includes reusable UI components, style guides, and design principles. This helps ensure uniformity across different parts of the product and across teams.

Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub-national service delivery.
Pillar 2: Better sub-national governance for service delivery.
Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.

SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara, Tanah Papua. In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and GEDSI.

In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and GEDSI.

Purpose

We are seeking a highly experienced COBOL professional to serve as a consultant on AI training data projects for leading AI model builders and enterprises.

You will be engaged on specific projects with clearly defined deliverables, milestones, and end dates.

Components

Technical Standard Setting, Quality Control, and Process Improvement

Define COBOL-specific quality success metrics for code annotation and dataset labeling projects.
Develop project-specific SOPs, QA rubrics, and reference materials to ensure outputs align with client technical standards.
Review project outputs (COBOL scripts, code annotations, legacy modernization samples) against defined standards, flagging and correcting defects before client delivery.
Conduct structured QA passes on deliverables; track, flag, and resolve defects efficiently to hit delivery timelines.
Return work to contractors with precise remediation notes and context on COBOL syntax, logic, and legacy system patterns.
Provide advisory input on tools, frameworks, emulators, and workflow improvements to maintain quality benchmarks in mainframe and batch-processing environments.
Handle spec changes and edge-case scenarios (e.g., different COBOL dialects, EBCDIC vs ASCII encoding, JCL dependencies) and draft corresponding acceptance criteria or workarounds.
Curate libraries of “gold standard” COBOL code samples, modernization examples, and dataset annotations for calibration and cross-project consistency.

Talent Vetting & Output Improvement

Participate in technical vetting of contractor talent, including reviewing COBOL code assessments and task-based evaluations.
Review sample outputs from contractors and provide clear, actionable written feedback to improve code correctness, readability, and efficiency.
Develop targeted training and calibration resources, such as:
COBOL code quality guidelines (e.g., data division consistency, paragraph structuring)
Best practices for clean, maintainable procedural code
Reference documentation for legacy system interaction patterns
Dataset labeling standards for COBOL-related model training
Project Delivery Support

Advise on technical scoping and requirements during project setup, including COBOL versioning, JCL integration, and mainframe data formats.
Provide expert guidance for edge cases and spec changes, such as handling copybooks, variable-length records, or integration with DB2 and VSAM.
Contribute to post-project reviews to capture lessons learned and continuously refine standards.
Identify and summarize client system insights, such as recurring syntax issues, logic errors, or data formatting inconsistencies.
Build dashboards or defect trackers with categorized issues to surface recurring themes and drive process improvements.
Conduct post-mortems to analyze defect trends and propose updated QA steps, documentation improvements, or refresher training.

Target Profile

5+ years of professional experience in COBOL programming, mainframe systems, or enterprise application maintenance, with demonstrable project impact.
Mastery of COBOL (and familiarity with JCL, DB2, CICS, or VSAM preferred).
Proven ability to define, enforce, and maintain high technical standards in legacy system environments.
Strong communication skills, with the ability to convey technical feedback clearly to both engineers and non-technical reviewers.
Experience developing technical documentation, QA frameworks, or training content for legacy or mainframe systems.
Ability to deliver against fixed project timelines and scopes.
Exceptional attention to detail and a commitment to accuracy, consistency, and documentation discipline.
Fluency in spoken and written English with clear, concise technical writing.

We offer a pay range of $25-to- $65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location.

Posted 5 Nov 2025 Closing date 17 Nov 2025

Location: Papua Region (Jayapura)

Program Background

Responsibilities

The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia’s large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program’s core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia’s previous 19 years of support to Indonesia’s decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:

Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub-national service delivery.

Pillar 2: Better sub-national governance for service delivery.

Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.

SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara, Tanah Papua. In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and GEDSI.

About DT Global Asia Pacific

At DT Global Asia Pacific, we aim to positively impact people’s lives through delivery excellence. As a leading implementing partner across Asia and the Pacific, we co-create locally led solutions in partnership with governments, communities, and stakeholders.

Invisible Expert Marketplace,Indonesia,Basque Language Specialist - AI Trainer,"About the job
Are you a Basque language expert eager to shape the future of AI? Large-scale language models are evolving from clever chatbots into powerful engines of linguistic discovery. With high-quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can democratize world-class education, keep pace with cutting-edge research, and streamline communication for Basque speakers everywhere. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI.

We’re looking for Basque language specialists who live and breathe Basque grammar, syntax, morphology, spelling, phonology, and pragmatics. You’ll challenge advanced language models on topics like ergativity, verb conjugation, noun declension, sentence structure, dialectal variation, formal and informal speech, and the nuances of the Basque writing system—documenting every failure mode so we can harden model reasoning.

On a typical day, you will converse with the model on language scenarios, verify factual accuracy and logical soundness, capture reproducible error traces, and suggest improvements to our prompt engineering and evaluation metrics.

A master’s or PhD in Basque language, linguistics, or a closely related field is ideal; peer-reviewed publications, teaching experience, or hands-on linguistic analysis projects signal fit. Clear, metacognitive communication—“showing your work”—is essential.

Ready to turn your Basque language expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world.

We offer a pay range of $8 to $65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor, you’ll supply a secure computer and high-speed internet; company-sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.
